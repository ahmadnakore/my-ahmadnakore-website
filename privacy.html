  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <!-- update date --> September 2025</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how apps published by <strong>Ahmad Nukuri</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) collect, use, and share information. It applies to all of our iOS apps (collectively, the “Apps”). By using the Apps, you agree to this Policy.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No account required.</strong> Our Apps can be used without creating an account.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage & diagnostics.</strong> We may collect non-identifiable usage data (e.g., feature engagement, crash logs, device type) to improve stability and performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising & analytics.</strong> Some Apps use third-party SDKs (e.g., Google AdMob, Firebase) which may collect device identifiers and usage information to show ads and measure performance. Their processing is governed by their own policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve features and performance</li>
    <li>Support purchases and subscriptions</li>
    <li>Detect and fix crashes, prevent abuse</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>In-App Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>Payments are processed by Apple. We do not receive your full payment information. Auto-renewing subscriptions are managed in your Apple ID settings. Terms of Use (EULA): 
    <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Standard EULA</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or rent personal data. We may share non-identifiable data with service providers (e.g., ads/analytics) strictly to operate and improve the Apps.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our Apps are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us to delete it.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can reset your device’s advertising identifier and limit ad tracking in iOS settings.</li>
    <li>You may uninstall the App to stop all data collection by the App.</li>
    <li>To access or delete data controlled by third-party SDKs, contact them directly (e.g., Google/AdMob, Firebase).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security & Retention</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable safeguards and retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes described above or as required by law.</p>
